    Info Dump:

    rvest is a R data scraping tool, and selenium is a headless browser (tester)

    scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch are ML libraries in Python

    LangChain.py Python, an LLM version of scikit-learn, which is a model-agnostic (black box models)
        So this program implements the scikit-learn ml package to build LLMs.

        You can use "tools" in LangChain, which expose the internet, code interpreters, etc. to the LLM.
            This is like in ChatGpt or claude, in their addons.
            Allows it to access information it wasn't trained on
